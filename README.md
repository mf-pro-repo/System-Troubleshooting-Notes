# Troubleshooting Notes

This repo is a collection of real-world troubleshooting cases and practical fixes on end user devices, performed by me. Focused on diagnosing system issues, isolating root causes, and applying effective solutions in real environments.


## About This Repository

This repository documents real-world troubleshooting scenarios encountered in varied enviornments. The focus is on:
- Methodical diagnostics
- Root-cause analysis
- Practical decision-making
- Lessons learned from both complex and everyday issues

Write-ups are intentionally concise and based on real outcomes rather than theoretical scenarios.

## Structure

- **advanced-cases/**  
  In-depth troubleshooting scenarios involving complex or misleading system behavior. Or lessons learned the hard way.

- **practical-fixes/**  
  Short, real-world fixes that emphasize efficiency, minimizing downtime, and ingenuity.

## How to Read These Cases

Advanced cases can be long and include context, investigation steps, reasoning, and lessons learned.  
Practical fixes focus on the problem, action taken, and outcome.

All examples are real and selected to demonstrate technical judgment rather than volume. 

## Note on Documentation

Many of these cases were handled informally for friends or family rather than in a fully documented professional environment. As a result, not every command, parameter, or exact sequence is captured or is summarized.
Write-ups are done after the fact and focus on the reasoning, investigation, and lessons learned rather than precise reproduction.
