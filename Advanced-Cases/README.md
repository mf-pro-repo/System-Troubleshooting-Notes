# Advanced Troubleshooting Cases

This directory contains in-depth troubleshooting write-ups involving complex, misleading, or intermittent system behavior. These cases often required extended investigation, multiple hypotheses, and careful isolation of variables. Or are based on hard learned lessons.

## What Makes These Cases Advanced

Cases in this section typically involve one or more of the following:
- Intermittent or non-deterministic failures
- Symptoms that point to the wrong component
- Limited, conflicting, or misleading diagnostic data
- Failures that persist across hardware or software changes
- Situations where judgment and restraint were as important as technical steps
- Situations where mistakes or oversights had real consequences, highlighting lessons learned and improved decision-making.

## How to Read These Write-Ups

These write-ups focus on reasoning, investigation paths, and lessons learned rather than exhaustive procedural detail. They are intended to show how problems were approached and evaluated under real-world constraints.
