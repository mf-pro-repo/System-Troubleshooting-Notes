# Case Study: Wi-Fi Adapter Not Working, No Wired Option

## Environment
- Windows 11 Pro
- Corperate user, working from home.
- No wired network connection available
- Symptoms:
  - Wi-Fi adapter not detected or failing to connect
  - User unable to download drivers directly

## Initial Observation
- User reported that Wi-Fi stopped working and had no access to wired connectivity.
- Device Manager showed the adapter present but with limited functionality; drivers could not be updated directly from Windows.

## Troubleshooting Steps
### 1. Verification
- Confirmed the Wi-Fi adapter was recognized by the system.
- Checked for obvious driver corruption or conflicts — none were immediately resolvable through Device Manager.

### 2. Alternative Access
- Advised the user to use a secondary device (Android phone) for temporary network access via USB tethering.
- This allowed the system to reach the internet for downloading the correct drivers safely.

### 3. Driver Installation
- Downloaded and installed the official Wi-Fi adapter drivers.
- Confirmed proper functionality after installation.

### 4. Verification & Testing
- Adapter successfully connected to home Wi-Fi network.
- Tested stable internet connectivity and confirmed the issue was resolved.

## Lessons Learned
- Limited connectivity scenarios may require creative, temporary workarounds to enable proper troubleshooting.
- Having a secondary device or method to access the network is valuable when primary adapters fail.
- Straightforward driver updates can resolve seemingly complex connectivity issues when proper access is ensured.
